## Course description

This course may differ a little from the math courses you have had in the past. Rather than focusing solely on calculation and answer, we will spend some time learning the language to express complex statements and the logic to verify they are correct. We will spend particular effort in learning mathematical induction, which is a method to prove a statement is true in infinitely many cases at once.

In addition to studying mathematical language and logic, we will cover several key content areas including combinatorics, graph theory, and number theory.

### Anticipated learning outcomes

* Comfort reading and writing mathematical language and logic
* Read proofs and apply mathematical statements
* Possess knowledge in content areas
* Appreciation for abstract mathematics, problem-solving, rigor

### Rough plan

* Weeks 1-4: Mathematical language, sets and functions, combinatorics
* Week 5: Catch-up and take-home exam
* Weeks 6-9: Sequences, induction, logic, proofs
* Week 10: Catch-up and take-home exam
* Weeks 11-14: Graph theory, modular arithmetic
* Weeks 15-16: Catch-up and take-home exam

### Course format

The course will be delivered through synchronous remote class sessions. Each session will include a mixture of questions on previous material, discussion of new material, and group activities.

## Grading

### Attendance, participation, and group activities 20%

You are expected to attend remote class sessions, and to be prepared to ask questions and discuss the material. Following the discussion, we will work on group activities, which will be submitted as a group via gradescope. A portion of your grade will be based on your attendance, preparedness, attention, collaboration, and completion of these activities.

### Homework assignments 35%

Homework will be assigned each week via Webwork. Most exercises will be graded by the system, but a few may be typewritten and instructor-graded. You are encouraged to collaborate with your peers, and to use any available resources. For typewritten answers, please keep in mind that you must always fully understand your solutions and most importantly *write them in your own words*.

### Take-home exams 15% x3

Take-home exams will be given during the 5th week, 10th week, and the finals week of the class.
